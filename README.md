A zombie gamemode for FiveM with a big focus on letting the player adventure the map to find random scenarios involving AI survivors and zombies.

This mod is still in an early WIP phase.

## Installation
- Download the resource.
- Extract the zipfile and copy all files to `resources/corruptsnail/`.
- Open **server.cfg** and add `ensure corruptsnail`.

**TODO:**
- Add a leveling system (XP could probably be gained by killing zombies or completing random missions)
- Add safezones where players can meet each other, restock on ammo, get random items or accept random missions
- Have heavily armed AI guarding the safezones
- Spawn the player in a random location on death / first join with just a pistol and only make safezone blips visible for them
- Make it possible for players to collect a phone and map for free in every safezone to gain access to all-map communication, make all players who also have a phone visible on the map and make all hidden blips visible
- Dynamic spawning system (there should be way more zombies spawning in Los Santos than in the desert in the middle of nowhere)
- Random AI survivor scenarios (i.e. rebel groups or military helis flying by like in the old version of CorruptSnail, can either be friendly or hostile)
